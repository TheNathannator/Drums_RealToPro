# Real Drums to Pro Drums Converter

This program will search a folder for .mid charts and copy the Phase Shift Real Drums track to a
standard Drums track if standard Drums does not exist in that chart.

## Usage

This program can be launched either directly, or through a command prompt.

Launching directly by double-clicking the .exe is simplest and the most user-friendly.
When launched directly, it will prompt for a path to search for. If you don't specify a path in that prompt,
it will create a Songs folder if one doesn't exist and prompt you to move the songs to it.

When launched from a command prompt, you may specify a file path as an argument:

```
./Drums_RealToPro.exe "C:\path\to\songs"
```
